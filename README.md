# A Guide to Working with Charles

A guide to set expectations on how best to work with Michelle.

## Work Environment

I'll often be wearing headphones and listening to music to alleviate distractions. Interruptions via chat are disruptive to my workflow.

All writing and coding is primarily in Atom.  

## Communication

Short, quick communications are in chat. Longer form thoughts without the need of real-time discussion are better in email or a shared document.

If it has a URL please include a link for context.

I like to discussing ideas and get feedback often. During discussions, I will often be taking notes. I greatly appreciate any follow-up email to further flesh out discussion topics.

## Schedule

I'm located in San Francisco in the **pacific timezone**. My mornings are busy feeding and dressing my person; then  driving him to preschool. I prefer an early lunch. My husband works full time too, so **schedule adjustments require advanced planning**.

My weekday typically follows this schedule:

| Time (PT)| Activity                         |
| ------: | --------------------------------- |
|  12–7am | sleep                             |
|   7–9am | prepping and preschool drop off   |
|  9–12pm | work                              |
|  12-1pm | lunch                             |
|   1–5pm | work                              |
|5-5:30pm | preschool pickup                  |
|5:30–7pm | family and dinner time            |
|   7–9pm | kid's bath, books, and bed time   |
|  9–12pm | work, leisure, sleep              |

My work hours and lunch are flexible, but the morning and night routines with the kids are **not** flexible.

Please do plan meetings a day to a week in advance with an agenda so I can be prepared.
